# Agent Roll Cage (ARC) V0.1
ARC will be WillFreeAI's primary deployment platform for libraries of agentic frameworks. It will host open-source fine-tuned models for specialized agents, including those for function calling, programming, LaTeX mathematics, synthetic dataset generation, and more. Our goal with ARC is to create a comprehensive platform that supports the development and deployment of advanced agentic systems, making powerful AI tools accessible to everyone.

## Announcing WillFreeAI: Revolutionizing AI Agentic Frameworks
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-agentic-action-space-frameworks-willfreeai-8enre/?trackingId=V1T6bxZ0Sg6NKYUaBlciiw%3D%3D

Artificial intelligence is the most rapidly growing technology in the world. From everyday people to companies and organizations, AI has made revolutionary changes that will ultimately bear fruit for our world, our children, and our legacy. I am excited to announce the founding of WillFreeAI, an open-source AI software organization devoted to Supervised Fine Tuning with an emphasis on Multimodal Super Alignment by Building Agentic Framework Action Spaces & Intercommunication Protocols.

2. **Install CUDA and cuDNN**:
   [CUDA Installation Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html)

3. **Install PostgreSQL (psql)**:
   [PostgreSQL Installation Guide](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

4. **Open psql shell, enter default commands, and follow database setup template below:**

```sql
CREATE USER your_username WITH PASSWORD 'your_password' SUPERUSER;
CREATE DATABASE memory_agent;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA public TO your_username;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE memory_agent TO your_username;
\c memory_agent

SELECT * FROM conversations;

CREATE TABLE conversations (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    prompt TEXT NOT NULL,
    response TEXT NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO conversations (timestamp, prompt, response) 
VALUES 
(NOW(), 'Example prompt 1', 'Example response 1'),
(NOW(), 'Example prompt 2', 'Example response 2'),
(NOW(), 'Example prompt 3', 'Example response 3');
SELECT * FROM conversations;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLE conversations TO [name];
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCE conversations_id_seq TO [name];

\q
```

Your psql db should be good to go :)
