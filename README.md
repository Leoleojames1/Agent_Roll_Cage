## About Llama 3
Introducing the New 8B and 70B Parameter Llama 3 Models. Llama 3 represents a major leap over Llama 2, establishing a new state-of-the-art for large language models (LLMs) at these scales.

🚀 **State-of-the-Art Performance:**
- Best models available today at the 8B and 70B parameter scale.

🎛️ **Greater Steerability:**
- More controllable and adaptable model responses.

🔄 **Enhanced Pretraining and Post-Training:**
- Substantially reduced false refusal rates.
- Improved alignment and increased diversity in model responses.

💡 **Improved Capabilities:**
- Enhanced reasoning.
- Advanced code generation.
- Better instruction following.

## Announcing WillFreeAI: Revolutionizing AI Agentic Frameworks
Artificial intelligence is the most rapidly growing technology in the world. From everyday people to companies and organizations, AI has made revolutionary changes that will ultimately bear fruit for our world, our children, and our legacy.

I am excited to announce the founding of WillFreeAI, an open-source AI software organization devoted to Supervised Fine Tuning with an emphasis on Multimodal Super Alignment by Building Agentic Framework Action Spaces & Intercommunication Protocols.

## Agent Roll Cage (ARC) V1.0
ARC will be WillFreeAI's primary deployment platform for libraries of agentic frameworks. It will host open-source fine-tuned models for specialized agents, including those for function calling, programming, LaTeX mathematics, synthetic dataset generation, and more. Our goal with ARC is to create a comprehensive platform that supports the development and deployment of advanced agentic systems, making powerful AI tools accessible to everyone.

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. **Install Miniconda 3**: 
   [Miniconda Installation Guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
2. **Install CUDA and cuDNN**:
   [CUDA Installation Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html)
3. **Install PostgreSQL (psql)**:
   [PostgreSQL Installation Guide](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
4. **Open psql shell, enter default commands, and follow database setup template below:**

CREATE USER your_username WITH PASSWORD 'your_password' SUPERUSER;
CREATE DATABASE memory_agent;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA public TO your_username;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE memory_agent TO your_username;
\c memory_agent

SELECT * FROM conversations;

CREATE TABLE conversations (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    prompt TEXT NOT NULL,
    response TEXT NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO conversations (timestamp, prompt, response) 
VALUES 
(NOW(), 'Example prompt 1', 'Example response 1'),
(NOW(), 'Example prompt 2', 'Example response 2'),
(NOW(), 'Example prompt 3', 'Example response 3');
SELECT * FROM conversations;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLE conversations TO [name];
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCE conversations_id_seq TO [name];

\q

Your psql db should be good to go :)
